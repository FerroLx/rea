# Verification

Verified base: fork `FerroLx/rea`, branch `feat/2377-jvm-debug-metadata` off
upstream `main` at 26525706f.

## Domain core (landed)

- Focused domain tests: 3 files / 15 tests passed
  (`javaClassFile.test.ts` 6, `javaDebugMetadata.test.ts` 7,
  `javaDebugMetadataEvidence.test.ts` 2).
- Real-toolchain sanity check: `javac 25.0.4` compiled an owned `Example.java`
  with `-g` and `-g:none`. The parser → decoder → Evidence pipeline reported, on
  the real artifacts:
  - `-g`: `SourceFile = Example.java`; `compute(IJ)I` state `present` with 3
    `LineNumberTable` entries (source lines 3/4/5) and locals `this,a,b,x,i`
    name-resolved; `<init>` `present`.
  - `-g:none`: `SourceFile` absent; both methods `stripped`; coverage tally
    `{present:0, stripped:2}`.
    (Validation used a throwaway fixture; in-repo owned fixtures land with the
    verification-lane task.)
- `oxlint` on `src/domain/jvm/`: 0 errors, 0 warnings. `tsc --noEmit`: no errors
  in the new files. `verify:test-discovery`: all test files discovered once.

## Application / contract / CLI (landed)

- Service tests (19 total with the domain core): local-file inspection,
  relative-path rejection, unsupported-target and missing-file mapping.
- `inspect_jvm_debug_metadata` tool + `inspect-jvm-debug-metadata` CLI wired into
  composition, server, catalog, effect audit, and product-catalog family.
- MCP advertised-schema validity, CLI/MCP Evidence parity, and target-content
  provenance conformance pass; input schema is shallow and dialect-safe.

## Real-toolchain lane (landed)

`npm run verify:jvm` (JDK 25) compiles owned `javac` fixtures with `-g` and
`-g:none` — overloads, wide long/double locals, and a generic method that yields
a `LocalVariableTypeTable` — then cross-checks every decoded fact against
`javap` (SourceFile, LineNumberTable entry count, LocalVariableTable and
LocalVariableTypeTable presence, method descriptors), exercises the compiled CLI
and stdio MCP in Evidence parity, validates a real third-party JAR class
(fontbox/pdfbox when present), and asserts the unsupported-target and
truncated-input error surfaces. 10 cases pass; the reader never mutates the
selected bytes. Skips cleanly when no JDK is present.

## Independent review (three angles)

Three independent reviews (correctness/spec, security/resource/scope,
architecture/conventions) ran against the branch. Confirmed fixed:

- MAJOR — split (multiple) `LineNumberTable` / `LocalVariableTable` /
  `LocalVariableTypeTable` attributes are now merged into one table (JVMS
  §4.7.12–14), not truncated to the first; covered by a decode test.
- MAJOR — the projected result is now bounded by an 8 MiB inline output budget
  (`AnalysisResourceConstraintError`), mirroring the Go/Rust readers; covered by
  a service test.
- MAJOR — `JVM_PROVIDER_IDENTITY` is now surfaced in the generated provider
  catalog (`providers[]` attributes `inspect_jvm_debug_metadata`).
- MINOR — modified-UTF8 continuation bytes are validated (`invalid-utf8` on a
  malformed sequence); the dead `budget-exceeded:"constant-pool"` variant is
  removed.

The reviews verified correct: modified-UTF8 (including CESU-8 supplementary
pairs), constant-pool two-slot rule, Code-header skip, table strides/field
order, projection, layering, reuse, effect audit, and the deferral seam.

## JAR entry + multi-release (landed)

`entry` selects one class member from a `.jar` (read through the shared
`ZipArtifactReader`), and `release` selects a `META-INF/versions/<N>/` override.
Selection is explicit and non-combining: an omitted release reads the base; a
requested release must match a present override or the call is refused with the
available versions (`resolveJarSelection`, unit-tested). The JAR's digest is
streamed (`hashStableFile`, bounded by `archiveBytes`); the class entry is read
bounded by `inputBytes`. The subject is the JAR (`format: "zip"`) and the result
carries `container` + `selected_entry`. `verify:jvm` now builds a real
multi-release JAR (base at release 11, override at 17) and asserts base vs
explicit-17 selection (distinct SHA), absent-release refusal, and missing-entry
error, through the CLI and MCP — 16 cases total.

Out-of-range scope validation against `code_length` landed earlier (flagged
`out_of_range`, raw values preserved). Because HotSpot rejects such a class
("Invalid pc in LineNumberTable", "Invalid start_pc"/"Invalid length", and
"Invalid index" for a slot, or a `J`/`D` second slot, at or past `max_locals`),
a flagged entry or out-of-frame slot also makes its table `malformed`.

## Second independent review — JAR/multi-release + out-of-range (three angles)

A second three-angle review ran against the JAR/multi-release and out-of-range
changes. Confirmed fixed:

- MAJOR — the `Multi-Release: true` manifest attribute was not checked, so
  `META-INF/versions/<N>/` entries were honored even on a plain JAR where the
  runtime ignores them. The provider now reads the main manifest; versioned
  selection on a non-multi-release JAR is refused, and versioned directories are
  restricted to integers `>= 9` with no leading zeros.
- MAJOR — duplicate ZIP members at one entry/release were silently collapsed
  (last-wins) while selection reasoned about the first. Duplicate members at the
  selected entry/release are now refused as an ambiguous identity.
- MAJOR — `release` without `entry` was silently ignored yet recorded in
  Evidence. The input schema now rejects that combination at the shared boundary.
- MINOR — `scopeOutOfRange` start boundary corrected to `>=` (JVMS: start_pc <
  code_length); CLI `--release` uses `z.coerce.number().int().nonnegative()`.
- A non-JDK adapter test (`JvmClassFileProvider.test.ts`) builds JARs in-process
  with `@zip.js` and covers base/explicit-release/absent-release/missing-entry/
  non-multi-release/loose-with-entry, so the JAR path has coverage without a JDK.

The reviews verified correct: `resolveJarSelection` (exact match, never nearest;
explicit, non-combining), `classifyJarEntry` near-miss rejection, `#readEntryBytes`
sizing and bomb-bound, subject identity, merged repeatable tables, layering,
contract extension, and effect-audit honesty.

## Third review — usability and decoder strictness (landed)

A fourth-angle pass (architecture/security/correctness/usability) surfaced three
small items, all fixed:

- USABILITY — a `.jar` selected without `entry` previously failed as `bad-magic`
  ("not a class file"). The provider now detects the ZIP signature and returns an
  `AnalysisUnsupportedTargetError` whose remediation points at `entry` (and
  `release`) selection.
- USABILITY — a requested `entry` is normalized once at the JAR boundary
  (`normalizeJarEntryPath`: backslashes → `/`, leading slashes stripped) so a
  caller-supplied `\com\example\Foo.class` or `/com/...` resolves to the internal
  member path; the canonical form is what `selected_entry.entry` records.
- CORRECTNESS — modified-UTF8 decoding now rejects a stray continuation byte
  (`0x80–0xbf`) used as a two-byte lead, while still accepting the legal
  `0xc0 0x80` encoding of U+0000. Covered by two new domain tests.

Unit/service suite was 40 tests (6 files) at this point; `verify:jvm` 16 cases.
`tsc --noEmit` clean; `oxlint` reports only the pre-existing non-blocking
`max-params` warning on `#selectJarMember`. (The Fable-review section below
raises the suite to 53 tests in 7 files.)

## Real-artifact exercise via CLI and live MCP (landed)

Ran the built CLI and the live stdio MCP server against real on-disk artifacts
(not fixtures):

- `netty-handler-4.1.93.Final.jar` → `ChannelTrafficShapingHandler.class`: 10
  methods, all `present`, `SourceFile ChannelTrafficShapingHandler.java`.
  Cross-checked against `javap -v`: 10 `LineNumberTable` + 10 `LocalVariableTable`
  blocks — exact match. CLI and MCP returned byte-identical Evidence (same entry
  SHA-256, coverage).
- `gson-2.11.0.jar` (real `Multi-Release: true`): base `Gson.class` selects
  `release:null`; `module-info.class` with no release is refused (base absent,
  available `[9]`); `--release 9` selects the versioned override
  (`internal_name module-info`); `--release 11` is refused. Same over MCP.
- Real APKs from the Downloads folder (31–152 MiB ZIPs): selecting one without an
  `entry` returns `unsupported_target` steering the caller to member selection;
  `--entry classes.dex` is refused as not a class file; a missing member is a
  `not-found` input error. Verified over both CLI and MCP.

This exercise exposed a real defect in the first usability fix: an archive larger
than the 32 MiB class-file budget (most APKs) was rejected as oversized _before_
the ZIP magic could be examined, so the caller saw "select a smaller artifact"
instead of the member-selection hint. Fixed by classifying on a bounded magic
peek (`peekArtifactMagic`, leading bytes only, independent of total size) before
admitting the file under the class-file budget; covered by new adapter tests.

## Second independent (Fable) review — resolved (landed)

A full independent review on the Fable model ran against the branch and the
spec/plan. Fixed in commits on this branch:

- BLOCKING — the contract effect-wording gate (`toolEffects.test.ts`) failed:
  "No Java executes" matches the execution-wording pattern but the tool was not
  in `EXECUTION_WORDING_EXCEPTIONS`. Added (an earlier verification claim that
  the effect audit was green had not run this specific gate — now it does).
- RESOURCE (was "pending" below) — decoded entries are now capped by a cheap
  pre-count (`countDebugEntries`) and `maxDebugEntries` before any entry object
  is allocated; a 30 MiB crafted class with ~8M declared entries is refused in
  ~1 ms (previously ~1.5 GiB RSS). The "bounded before allocation" claim is now
  true, not aspirational.
- IDENTITY (was "pending" below) — the JAR is admitted once via
  `openRegularFile(symlinks:"reject")`; members and the digest are read through
  that one descriptor (`hashStableRootArtifactHandle`), re-validated at the end,
  so the TOCTOU window is closed and the symlink policy is consistent. The hash
  runs only after selection, so refusals skip the full-archive hash.
- An encrypted matching member is refused as unavailable-not-absent; a Mach-O
  universal binary (shared `0xCAFEBABE`) is steered to `inspect_macho`.
- Coverage: added unit tests for encrypted members, the Mach-O steer, symlink
  rejection, release-without-entry, already-aborted cancellation, CESU-8
  supplementary pairs, and the over-entry pre-count guard.
- Docs truthed up: spec states/ordering/unknowns/bounds wording; tasks.md status.

Unit/service suite is now 53 tests (7 files); `verify:jvm` 16 cases.

## Multi-release detection parity with the JDK (landed)

An adversarial audit compared REA with OpenJDK 25.0.4 `JarFile` on 25 crafted
JARs. REA trimmed and case-folded the attribute, honored the first duplicate,
accepted value continuations, and matched the manifest on the reader's
`./`-stripped logical path, case-sensitively. It disagreed with the JDK on 10
of 25 (m1–m3, m6, m12, m17, m21 and m23 read as multi-release; m4 and m22 did
not). `jarManifest.ts` now reproduces the JDK byte for byte: the stored
member name (`ArtifactEntry.storedPath`) matched case-insensitively, the
`Multi-Release: true` byte pre-filter, and `Attributes.read` with its 512-byte
line buffer, 8192-byte fills, strict `": "` separator, name validation and
last-duplicate-wins. Results:

- Crafted corpus through the built CLI: 25/25 agree with the JDK (was 15/25).
- Differential fuzz of `isMultiReleaseManifest` against `JarFile.isMultiRelease`:
  24,000 generated manifests and 452 line-buffer/fill-boundary cases, 0
  disagreements (the previous parser disagreed on 5,607).
- Real multi-release JARs (bcprov 1.81/1.84, kotlin-stdlib 2.4.0,
  guava 33.3.1): all 19 verdicts unchanged.

`parseVersionedJarEntry` now accepts only versions 9 to 2147483647 without
leading zeros, so an overflowing directory such as `99999999999` is no longer
listed as a release. Remaining known differences: REA never falls back to a
lower version or to the base entry when a requested release is absent (by
design), while the JDK also consults a `versions/8` directory during that
fallback. The JDK reads the raw central-directory name and ignores an Info-ZIP
Unicode Path extra field, which REA's ZIP reader prefers. A manifest member
the ZIP reader classifies as a directory or symlink is not read.

## JarFile parity and instruction boundaries

Four further differences from OpenJDK 21/25 were checked against the real
runtimes (`JarFile` probes, and `ClassFormatError`/`VerifyError` from loading
patched `javac` classes through a `URLClassLoader`) and fixed:

- `new JarFile(...)` throws "invalid CEN header (encrypted entry)" when any
  central-directory record sets flag bit 0, whichever member is requested (a
  local-header-only flag is ignored). The JDK view of the shared ZIP reader now
  refuses such an archive during enumeration.
- `JarFile` reads a class whatever unrelated members declare. The JVM provider
  now charges the decompression budget only for members it opens (the manifest
  and the selected class); entry count and central-directory size stay bounded
  by the metadata read budget. Other ZIP consumers keep enumeration-time
  accounting.
- `JarFile.getEntry` never versions a `META-INF/` name, so
  `META-INF/versions/<N>/META-INF/...` is a plain member, not an override.
- From class version 51 HotSpot's verifier rejects a `LocalVariableTable` scope
  whose start, or whose end short of `code_length`, is not an instruction start
  ("Illegal local variable table start_pc"/"length"); `wide` counts as part of
  its instruction and switch padding is aligned from the code start. Version 49
  and 50 classes load (50 fails over to the old verifier), and so does a class
  loaded without verification. A `LocalVariableTypeTable` row inside an
  instruction is rejected too, either through its misaligned twin or as
  matching no row. Line-number `start_pc` values have no boundary rule. Local
  entries now carry `scope` (`aligned`, `in-code`, `misaligned`,
  `out-of-range`, `unknown`) in place of `out_of_range`; an undecodable
  instruction stream (each tested form gives `VerifyError: Bad instruction`
  or, for 0xcb, an earlier boundary `ClassFormatError`) leaves scopes
  `unknown` and the table `malformed`.

## Still owed (follow-ups, not blocking)

- A JDK-free CLI/MCP workflow test (e.g. `localToolContracts` pathRequests plus
  a boundary MCP case) so CI without a JDK still exercises the tool end to end.
- Real-lane fixtures for a truncated-table and an R8/ProGuard scrambled-table
  class (unit-covered today).
- Discoverability surfaces (README capability row, reverse-engineer-anything
  skill source, `architecture.mermaid`) — F8.
- Remaining F9–F11 items: HotSpot-reject parity beyond the landed checks
  (SourceFile length and Utf8 target, Utf8 local-variable names, repeated
  Code/SourceFile/SourceDebugExtension → malformed, out-of-range line pcs,
  trailing Code bytes) and a `detail` summary mode.
- `npm run check:pr` and full module-boundary/architecture guards at PR time.
  `docs:check` currently fails only on a pre-existing, unrelated `README_tr`
  link drift.

## Limits

No Java executes; no source URL resolved; supplied source bytes are never
claimed to match a `SourceFile`. Debug-metadata identity stays separate from any
decompiler output. Token usage and peak process-family memory unmeasured.
Real-toolchain validation so far covers Linux + JDK 25 only.
