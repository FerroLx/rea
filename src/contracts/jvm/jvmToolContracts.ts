    "Inspect compiler-emitted debug metadata in one selected local JVM .class file, or one class entry selected from a local .jar, to judge debugging readiness before attaching a debugger. Reads SourceFile, SourceDebugExtension, LineNumberTable, LocalVariableTable and LocalVariableTypeTable and binds bytecode offsets, local slots and scope ranges to each method's name and descriptor. Classifies every method as present, partial, stripped, malformed or not-applicable, flags line and local-variable positions HotSpot rejects (outside the code, or a local scope inside an instruction from class version 51), and reports examined coverage. For a JAR, pass entry (the class member path) and optionally release to select a multi-release override; selection is explicit and never silently combines versions. Decompiler line numbers are not substituted for compiler positions. No Java executes; no source URL is resolved; supplied source is never claimed to match a SourceFile name. SourceDebugExtension is reported by presence and byte length only; its bytes are neither returned nor interpreted. SHA-256 identifies the exact selected bytes, not authenticity.",
